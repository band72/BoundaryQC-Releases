## Overview

**BoundaryQC** is a professional-grade WPF desktop application built for land surveyors, civil engineers, and GIS professionals. It converts legal deed descriptions and survey plat images into mathematically verified, CAD-ready DXF geometry — automatically.

Powered by the **Google Gemini AI** engine, BoundaryQC handles the full pipeline from raw text or scanned plat image to a finished, closed boundary traverse with sub-foot accuracy.

## ✨ Features at a Glance

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **AI Deed Drafting** | Paste any legal description — the AI extracts bearings, distances, curves, and meanders and converts them to a closed DXF traverse |
| **Survey Plat Vision** | Upload a scanned plat image; the vision model extracts the call table and drafts the geometry automatically |
| **Batch Processing** | Process entire folders of mixed file types (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`) with parallel AI agents |
| **Multi-Stage Repair Engine** | Dual-run consensus voting → AI misclosure repair → Adjacent Lot Isolation, applied automatically in sequence until closure is achieved |
| **DXF Export & Viewer** | Full CAD-ready DXF output with a built-in viewer — inspect geometry before opening in AutoCAD or Civil 3D |
| **2-Page ANSI-B PDF** | Every deed produces a professional deliverable: Page 1 is a to-scale boundary sketch; Page 2 contains the legal description, line data table, COGO coordinates, and traverse closure report |
| **Legal Description Writer** | Interactive editor to manually compose or correct survey calls with real-time closure feedback |
| **AI Agent Chat** | Conversational AI interface — drop an image or paste text and get a full DXF + deliverable set |
| **Auto-Update** | Background version checks with an in-app notification banner when a new release is available |
| **Custom AI Engine** | Configure custom OpenAI-compatible API endpoints (e.g. Ollama, Local AI, alternative providers) with custom model names and API keys |

## 🤖 AI Processing Pipelines

BoundaryQC offers four entry points, each tuned for a different workflow.

### 1 — Deed DXF  *(text input)*

Best for: pasting a plain-text legal description directly.

```
Paste legal description
        ↓
ExtractDeedCallsAsync   ← text-to-JSON AI prompt
        ↓
DeedDrafter.GenerateDeedDxf
        ↓
error > 0.05' ? → SolveMisclosureAsync → regenerate
```

**Output:** DXF · OCR.txt · Cogo.txt · Cogo-Script.txt · QC_Report.txt · 2-page PDF

---

### 2 — Plat DXF  *(scanned plat image)*

Best for: uploading a scanned or photographed survey plat image.

```
Upload plat image (+ optional table image)
        ↓
ExtractPlatCallsFromImageAsync   ← vision model, V3 pattern recognition
        ↓
DeedDrafter.GenerateDeedDxf
        ↓
error > 1.0' ? → Run extraction a 2nd time, keep lower-error result (consensus)
        ↓
error > 1.0' ? → SolvePlatMisclosureAsync (heavy repair)
        ↓
error > 0.30' ? → AdjacentLotIsolator.IsolateAsync (focused segment isolation)
```

**Output:** DXF · OCR.txt · Cogo.txt · Cogo-Script.txt · QC_Report.txt · 2-page PDF

---

### 3 — Batch  *(folder of mixed files)*

Best for: processing dozens or hundreds of deeds unattended.

```
Classify each file (PLAT / TEXT / SECTION_BREAKDOWN / LOT_BLOCK)
        ↓
PLAT  → ExtractPlatCallsFromImageAsync (vision model, V3 pattern recognition)
TEXT  → ExtractTextFromFile + ExtractDeedCallsAsync
        ↓
error > 1.0' ? → Run extraction a 2nd time, keep lower-error result (consensus)
        ↓
DeedDrafter.GenerateDeedDxf
        ↓
error > 1.0' ? → SolvePlatMisclosureAsync (heavy repair)
        ↓
error > 0.30' ? → AdjacentLotIsolator.IsolateAsync (focused segment isolation)
```

**Output per item:** DXF · OCR.txt · Cogo.txt · Cogo-Script.txt · QC_Report.txt · 2-page PDF  
**Batch summary:** `ProcessingSummary.txt` with closure stats for every item

---

### 4 — AI Agent Chat  *(interactive)*

Best for: one-off images or conversational deed processing with live feedback.

```
Image attachment → ExtractPlatCallsFromImageAsync
     or
Typed text      → ExtractDeedCallsAsync
        ↓
DeedDrafter.GenerateDeedDxf
        ↓
SolveMisclosureAsync (if needed)
```

**Output:** Full file set dropped beside the original image.

### Pipeline Capability Matrix

| Capability | Deed DXF | Plat DXF | Batch | AI Agent | Writer |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Document auto-classification | — | — | ✅ | — | — |
| Vision model (scanned plats) | — | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| V3 pattern recognition | — | ✅ | ✅ | partial | — |
| Dual-run consensus voting | — | ✅ | ✅ | — | — |
| AI misclosure repair | ✅ light | ✅ heavy | ✅ heavy | ✅ light | ✅ |
| Adjacent lot isolation engine | — | ✅ | ✅ | — | — |
| 2-page ANSI-B survey PDF | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| **Success Rate (%)** | **88.5%** | **50%** | **90%** | **70%** | **67.2%** |
| **Production Ready** | No | No | **Yes** | No | No |

> All four paths share the same final step — `DeedDrafter.GenerateDeedDxf()` — which writes the complete output.  
> **Production Ready** = ≥ 90% completion of required functional goals, with no critical failures and acceptable risk on remaining items.

## 🔧 Automated Repair System

When a traverse does not close mathematically, BoundaryQC applies repairs in sequence until the error falls within tolerance:

### Stage 1 — Bowtie Auto-Fix
Self-intersecting geometry ("bowtie" polygons) is detected using vector cross-products. BoundaryQC iteratively identifies the offending bearing quadrant, swaps it, and re-tests until the polygon ring seals cleanly.

### Stage 2 — Dual-Run Consensus Voting
If closure error exceeds **1.0 ft**, the AI extraction is run a second time independently. Whichever of the two runs produces the lower linear error is retained for final output.

### Stage 3 — AI Misclosure Repair
A dedicated repair prompt (`SolvePlatMisclosureAsync`) is given the original image, the extracted JSON, and the full closure diagnostic. The AI identifies and corrects the specific erroneous bearing or distance.

### Stage 4 — Adjacent Lot Isolation Engine
If error remains above **0.30 ft** after AI repair, BoundaryQC extracts the boundary calls of neighboring lots from the same plat. Any shared segment verified by a neighbor that closes perfectly is confirmed correct. The remaining unverified segments are flagged as suspects and targeted with a focused AI repair pass. A multi-lot combined DXF is written with each lot on its own named layer.

## 🗂️ Document Classification

BoundaryQC automatically routes each document to the correct extraction pipeline:

| Classification | Description | Pipeline |
|---|---|---|
| `METES_BOUNDS` | Standard deed with bearing/distance calls | `ExtractDeedCallsAsync` → DXF traverse |
| `SECTION_BREAKDOWN` | Pure PLSS aliquot fractions (no bearing calls) | Compute ideal rectangle from aliquot fractions |
| `QUALIFIED_PLSS` | PLSS parent trimmed by road R/W or offset | Compute gross parent → apply clip lines |
| `LOT_BLOCK` | Subdivision lot-and-block reference | `LotBlockDrafter` |
| `PLAT` | Scanned survey plat image | Vision model → `ExtractPlatCallsFromImageAsync` |

---

## 🖥️ Headless / CLI Mode

BoundaryQC supports a full headless CLI for server or script-driven automation:

```bash
# Single image
BoundaryQC.exe --image plat.png --table table.png

# Batch folder
BoundaryQC.exe --batch "C:\Deeds\Regency-Title" --output "C:\Output"

# Adjacent lot isolation
BoundaryQC.exe --image plat.png --adjacent-lots "Lot 712,Lot 714,Lot 716"

# Validate table-crop thresholds
BoundaryQC.exe --validate-correct-crops "C:\crops-correct"
```

Parallel batch mode forks up to **15 concurrent AI agents** — configure under **Settings → Output → Use Multiple Agents**.
